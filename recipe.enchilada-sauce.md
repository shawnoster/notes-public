# Enchilada Sauce

## Ingredients

- `2oz` dried Guidijallo chillis (1 package)
- `2oz` dried Ancho chillies (1 package)

## Steps

1. Prep - Chicken Stock

- Make sure you have some, otherwise make it now

1. Prep

- Cut the tops off the peppers, de-seed
  - if straining at the end don't worry about the seeds so much
  - some say they can taste bitter
- Chop the onion
- Chop the garlic

1. Toast the Peppers

- Mediumish heated cast iron
  - If you have a hot oven that works too
- Toasting, not roasting
  - chared bites will taste bitter
- Until almost puffing, not bursting

1. Rehydrate

- Soak in the hotest tap water
- Around ~20 min, they don't have to be mush, just blendable
- While waiting cook up your onion and garlic
- Save a cup of that soak juice
- Put in blender

1. Cook Onion and Garlic

- Onions in oil und opaque (don't rush it)
- Garlic when they look close, don't burn it
- I threw my cumin in at the end to bloom it, seemed to work
- Toss the whole mess in blender with peppers

1. Blend it All

- Thin it out with a mix of soak water and chicken stock
    - Soak water is earthy, like dirt earthy, use it sparingly your first time
- Add until it's your favorite level. If you don't have one yet aim for a smooth pasta sauce. It's used in a similiar fashion (to cook food in it, or coat food with it, as a compliment)
