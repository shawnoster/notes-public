# Engineering Commitment to Innovation

## Summary

A proposal to align the enginnering culture.

## List of Initiatives

### Semantic Versioning of Common Libraries, w/ Release Notes

- Sprint Review includes updating the project changelog
- Each person describes their commits and any learnings
- Each new version is announcened
- Breaking changes link to individual CR
- Keep a change log
- Semantic versioning
- Product is responsible for updating the wording
- Engineering is responsible for understanding impact of changes

### API Versioning

- Need contract-based testing
- Defined agreements on supporting versions
- All breaking changes, before API rev, behind feature flags
- API contract changes are blocking

### API Response Codes

- Review board
- Start small, on an as need basis vs. boiling the ocean
- Examples are better than opinoin
- Adopted and documented across all public services
- Common error message JSON schema

### Common Service Patterns

- Our APIs are increadibly brittle, beta patterns casting unstable shadows
- Too much emotion, bias, shifting priorities
- Common message bus
- Common database replica pattern
- Fefined time-to-consistancy SLA
- Common seperation between a write and read databases
 
 ### Hackaton

- Propose a knowledge building expercise
- Pure Dapr-baesd, following eCommerce and Vehicle Camera examples
  - Still containered
  - No existing framework code
  - No custom logging, stock AppInsights provider
- Pure Azure Functions-based 
- Stock .NET

### Learning Day

- Every senior dev must present two times a year
- A new technology, an aspect of the platform

### Stock Templates

- Self-organizing is a double-edged sword
- Need a formal way to capture specs
- Formal way to do things

Oi, Zoran, ya always say "if I don't know about a problem I can't fix it". Mike you build confidence with the phrase, "bring me solutions, not problems" (very Patterson of you, as long as Patternson was known for being a strong leader, and also not a jerk).
