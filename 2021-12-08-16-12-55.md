While lacking any sense of morality, good and bad and all that, it knows irration. It’s learned to roughly identify what will be most frustrating for the object it’s attached to. Which is usual death.

It senses extreme frustration from living things.

The Order had surprisingly kept it longer than anyone else, and by a massive factor. Constantly dealing with planning issues, sometimes out centuries, kept them in a constant state of unrest yet they accepted it and found ways to still not be assholes.

For this reason almost any blessed member could handle the band workouts fear. In fact the band was often shocked at the holders desperate plea to be please be ported anywhere else. Anywhere.

This minor resonance with the Order let them suggest when it should teleport.
