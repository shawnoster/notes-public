# Turkey Enchiladas

## Ingredients

- `13 lb` turkey carcass, juices
- `All` left over meat
- `3-4` celery stalks, including leaves
- `1 large` onion, quartered
- `3-4` carrots, rough chopped
- `5-8 cloves` of garlic, smashed
- `1-2 pinch` of salt
- `1-2 pinch` of pepper

## Steps

### Prep _(10-20 min)_

1. Pick off all usable meat from the carcass
1. Chop and dice all the things

### Make a stock _(1-2 hours)_

This is a bit of "throw it in the pot and wait". All ingredients are eyeballed and

1. Drop carcass, celery, carrots, onions, garlic, salt and pepper into stock pot
1. Cover with cold water
1. Get it to a boil then reduce to a vigorous simmer
1. While the cooks down dice the meat

### Dice the meat _(10-15 min)_

1. Dice all the dark and light meat into `1/2` cubes (a basic dice)
1. Refrigerate until ready to assemble

### Check stock

Grab a spoon, give it a taste. Probably add more salt and pepper. It should taste like an incredible "chicken soup" base. Let it simmer until you could eat a bowl on its own.

### Strain and pick _(15 min)_

1. Strain through a fine mesh strainer, colander, cheesecloth or whatever help filter out bits from the broth.
1. Pick meat off the bones
