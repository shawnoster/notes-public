# Wintersail - Working the Door

## Background

The coastal town of Wintersail is well known for it's crystal clear waters, welcoming beaches, and wild parties, and has been for so long that it appears in more than a few Fey guides on places to party outside the Night Court.

Wintersail's latest guest, a Dragon Turtle on holiday with a few dozen of her closest followers, has decided to extend her stay and refuses to listen to anyone telling her otherwise. The resort owner is in a panic because the entire bay has been reserved by a group of priests that need that bay to perform a sealing ritual.

A ritual that must be performed or else something will be unleashed that will, according to the Order of the Tide, lead to the End-Of-The-World!!!

## Overview

The adventure is time-based and is broken into days. The party has five days to figure out how to get the Dragon Turtle out of the bay while preventing the end of the world and their actions impact how the various factions react.

## Adventure Hook

The characters have been talked into helping out a local resort in exchange for a free, all-expendses paid trip to Wintersail. As a group of 1st-level they're ideal for task, with reassurances that the work is proper stuff of legend and not just waiting tables like last time.

The party wakes up on the deck of ship, with Wintersail a slowly growing speck on the horizon, by a playful yet terrifing Orc Pirate Captain, shouting at them to get up and reminding them of why they're on his boat.

He singles the group out, telling them to look for the person having the least amount of fun on the beach, which is Shezem.

## Encounters in Wintersail

### Dragon Followers

Followers can be found in almost every party spot worth visiting along the beach, usually in groups of three to four, and identified by facial tattoos mimicing turtle face spot patterns. Unless antagonised they're relaxed, good-natured, happy to drink with a stranger that's buying, and open about their employeer.

If pushed to fight consult the "Fighting Followers" section.

## Locations

## Ommuran

Omu is an Ancient Dragon Turtle

A Dragon Turle and followers are also there to relax. The turtle is just floating in the middle of the bay and have decided to stay, which cuts into a centuries-old event, coming up in a week.

She’s also with egg, so the waters of the cove are incredibly soothing, though it takes a 20 DC to get her to admit it. By nature she’s a Business Owner, turning her previous life of being God of a string of islands, and her previous followers, into a thriving shipping security company, offering protection from pirates, sea monsters, grumpy gods, and general mayhem. Also, she’d just started doing Fey Frolics, leisure cruises to magical, yet dangerous destinations.

Her dragon ego, and self-indulgence is worse in her dragon folk and so while normally reasonable and one to honor agreements, this time she’s playing the dragon diva card hard. Being with egg makes shifting forms more difficult and is one of the very few times she’s semi-vulnerable. It would take a 25 SC to get her to change, with no magic adjustments allowed.

## Turtle Followers

Ommuran started as God to a large group of islands, worshipped for centuries, until she spent all her time protecting her islands while her horde barely grew. Applying what her and her people had learned protecting themselves, she reinvented her and her people as a security and operations outfit.

Her outfit is composed of a fleet of fast and nimble guide ships, multiple magically bonded agreements with various sea demi-gods, regional dragons, mages that owed her favor, and clerics from the few islands that still worshipped her, even though a bit judgey in calling her, in her current phase “The Confused God” or “Upsidedown” which to a turtle is pretty rude.

While a majority of her followers, or staff, are from her islands, there’s a wide range of other species, especially those that can breath underwater or fly through high winds. Regardless of species everyone is completely loyal, highly skilled, combat ready.

While they’re a bunch of bad assets normally they’re here on vacation too and aren’t looking for trouble. While constantly protective and attentive they’re relaxed by default and looking to celebrate.

Any amount of time talking to them will result in the party learning the back-story. They’re dying to share the good news of the egg.

They’re unconcerned about the over-staying their welcome, absorbing some of their leaders ambivalence and feeling cocking as tough security folk.

- if asked for tips or suggestions on how to get her to leave they’ll be upfront about offering something for her horde.
- any follower will happily setup as many meetings as the adventures would like



## Tides vs. Dragons

This conflict is the bay itself, and the amount of space the Oum takes up, not to mention how she gets grumpy when too many people invade her chill. With her lounging in the bay there's not enough room to shape runes on the water's surface to fulfil the rite.

The race ritual must happen from sunup to sundown the next day, non-stop, to be successful. Speed isn't important, only that a minimum three boats tracing follow the same loose path, marked by bueys and fey lights.

There is no option that works with both turtle and rite in the same bay and if the rite doesn't happen then very bad things will happen.

## Your Job

Your job is to get rid of the dragon however possible, before the incoming ritual party goers and Priests of Tides.

## Options

The best outcome is Oum being talked into leaving early, and with the party in her good graces due to her connections. A steady stream of flattery, a generous donation to her hoarde, or performing some small pampering quest for her in exchange will all result in her leaving happily and with a small token of her apprication.

Things will go from bad to worse if Oum or her followers are excessively threatened or if she's put in any real danger.

If she's still there when the rite starts, and she's not in a rage from people trying to kill her, she'll slowly start doing laps that perfectly follow the ritual rune. Other boats may join her without harm though her mass and magic make up for not having three boats so no world-ending event.

On the very slim chance that everything is so fucked that the ritual doesn't happen then a massive whirlpool forms...

### A Favor

The most common outcome is they talk to the dragon who offers a quest in exchange. It’s either to fetch something shiny, make her more comfortable, or get her drunk. 

She'll offer a quest the morning after a successful meeting, where they didn't try to kill her or piss her off. It'll be some treat or reminder of the islands or thing that makes dragons drunk.

Actual task can be improved or rolled, either way it should be easy for a single palyer to do in a single day. One or two easy encounters with one medium challange at the end. Both Dragon Followers and Priests will join if asked though the Priests will be tense around Followers and Followers will tend towards recklessness around Priests.

Mostly she wants to be distracted from daily life and egg pains.

- 10-20 - Fetch exotic food or drink item from the glacier towering over Winterfell.
- 21-30 - Get information on person snooping around their cabana
- 31-40 - Collect herb or potion to ease her pain
- 41-50 - Perform island ritual of good luck

### Charm

You need three successful charisma checks (15) for three days, failing resets. It can be anyone brought to the dragon, such as local bards, smooth talkers, charmers. Players are encouraged to meet locals and invite them.

- Inspiration for commenting on motherhood, the burden of leadership, or positive stories about her company
- One check allowed per day
- Resistant to all attempts at using magic to charm

### Bribe

- For 2% of her horde value they’ll bounce
- Priests can shoulder up to 1%, if asked
- Orc Pirate will shoulder the rest in exchange for 10% off her rates, including the top tier packages, good until the next ritual. A single successful charm for her to agree
- Merchants only have a modest amount, not enough to bother robbing

### Threaten 

- The only threat that’ll work is about her egg, and only if she’s sure they really know
- she’s utterly paranoid and, with a successful AC, will high-tail it out of there. On a nag 20 she’ll even pay them off
- if threstening her egg fails she’ll let them live after scaring them, as well a set 1-3 followers to tail the party for the rest of the time.
- a second attempt will get them rouged up
- both the followers and her will often hint at her being pregnant by making egg references
- the followers are protective but happy, they can confirm she’s with egg, with the clue “how her egg will glow!”

### Kill

Killing is technically an option but unless it’s very obviously in self-defense or unavoidable no one will reward this path, mostly because it’s bad for business and the amount of property damage involved.

Since she’s pregnant, just there for the heated pools, she will inflict maximum damage quickly and then flee, with her followers dying to a person to protect her.

### Other Reasons

- She's highly protective, will flee at hint of harm, but will remember...
- She's vain about her business and running a tight ship
  - She'll leave if her crew gets too rowdy out of worry for her reputation
  - Getting them massively drunk and encourgaging Priest fights will do it
  - If offered a lucritive contract she'll take it on the spot
- She's obsessed with managing her horde
  - Pointing out extra charges for staying past check-out without a new contract, and the magically binding pact that auto-teleports gold from her horde, will have her packed up and out in under 5 minutes
- She can get sun drunk and passout if not careful
  - Is out for an entire day
  - Can be towed around while passed out
  - If presented as a prank by her crew she'll laugh and leave
  - If captured or kept under she'll rage and destroy the town

## Have Fun!

You've arrived in Wintersail and it's everything they said and more. As you soak in the sights and views you see a pensive-looking gnome pushing her way through the welcoming crowd of visitors and vendors. Before you can move out her way she slaps a strong palm against your chest, almost exploding, "Welcome! Welcome! Oh thank the currents you're finally here! Yes, yes, soak it all in, isn't our town just wonderful? Agreed? Good, wonderful, this way, soak and walk as I always think in my head".

Shezem catchs you up with a non-stop stream of information. She owns one of the larger resorts, a few taverns, a smattering of food carts and is part investor in a few of the higher quality merchent storefronts.

After she'd made it very clear, and you'd made the correct noises back, that normally her establishment is as efficent as a kobold death trap she explained that she was having trouble with one of her guests staying past their welcome and needed some outside help in conviencing her to leave.

She explains about the Dragon Turtle, the Rite of Tides, the possible end of the world, and that the dragon can't stay sober long enough to be sensible and has stopped seeing anyone on her staff, in her family, or that she's sat next to for too long.

You have five days before the end of the world to get rid of that dragon.

- Passage and all-inclusive room and board is your payment, plus a ticket back
- All contracts are magically binding
- She can point you to anyone for information
- Can provide basics but town has little need for weapons and armor
- 20g per day, per person
- Will not support or consider killing

## Rewards

### Maximum

Sweet talking, flattering, paying respectfully, or a quest or two will all result in everyone being happy and rewarding the party well. The Dragon will be quite free with items and tokens from her hoard, depending on how much they flatter her egg and/or business.

The Priests will be grateful and provide moderate apprication but are too busy already planning the next ritual to give the party much notice.

Wintersail will think the party is great fun, add it to their list of stories, and offer wild tales of adventures. 

### Medium

Any threats towards against the egg puts you on Oum's shit list so the party gets nothing from her except her backside. The followers will treat you coldly and you'll never feel quite comfortable on a ship they're doing security for.

Again, the priests don't care how it happened so they'll offer the same reward.

Wintersail will view the party neaturally, not liking how it happened but understanding why you had to do it.
