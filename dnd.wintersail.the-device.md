# The Device

## History

Forged from raw materails unique to each plane, in exacting equal amounts, and bound together with echos of the First World, it's constantly searching for a stable state. This independence allows it to be placed on unwilling beings or inanimate objects.

This of course pisses it off, a lot, hence why it jumps to the least convient plane for whatever it's attached to.

## Apperance

Physically, the planer teleportation device appears as simple, elegant, yet eye-catching band, a hands-width wide, that'll adjust to anysize between a Small wrist to a Large well-muscled biscpe (or chest band for the tiny humans, so small, so weak).

Magically it registers only as a size-adjusting piece of jewelery with a minor glamor to make it appear more interesting, similiar to other medium-priced jewewlery where it's easier to spell an item than create dozens of different sized copies.

## Identifying

A 20 DC is required by a 10th level magic-user or above to even hint that it might be something more. Two more successful attempts must be made by different mages, each of a higher level than the last. On the third success the item will waken to full sentience.

From the items point of view it's not magic at all, it's in the wrong place. 

It's considered a cursed item, though no remove curse will work since it's nature is due to a magical hex. Potentially a quest can be built around figuring out what the item is and how to destory or free it.

The device itself is so rare and powerful that it can be sold, if a buyer can be found, for the other half of the donation. The Priests won't consider this, and will push back if it's suggested, due to how powerful it is.

> Sol sighs, "Better to live with the guilt of knowing who and what I've killed than the overwhelming terror of never knowing what I unleashed by placing such terrible weight into eager and searching hands."

## Bribe

Oum will accept the device, along with the Priest's money, in exchange for clearing the bay. 

The priests will initially resist, needing an evening to talk it over. The second time they're asked they'll agree. 

Regardless of intent the Priests won't give the amulet until everyone in the party offers their Word. This provides options for the party to use deception or force to acquire it, either by sneaking and theft, capture, guile, magic influence, etc.
