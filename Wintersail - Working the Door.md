# Wintersail - Working the Door

Wintersail

New adventurer talked into an easy option as someone just starting on a new path. Wakes up on the deck of a Orc pirate captain’s deck.

_why did you start to adventure_

## The Turtle

A Dragon Turle and followers are also there to relax. The turtle is just floating in the middle of the bay and have decided to stay, which cuts into a centuries-old event, coming up in a week.

She’s also with egg, so the waters of the cove are incredibly soothing, though it takes a 20 DC to get her to admit it. By nature she’s a Business Owner, turning her previous life of being God of a string of islands, and her previous followers, into a thriving shipping security company, offering protection from pirates, sea monsters, grumpy gods, and general mayhem. Also, she’d just started doing Fey Frolics, leisure cruises to magical, yet dangerous destinations.

Her dragon ego, and self-indulgence is worse in her dragon folk and so while normally reasonable and one to honor agreements, this time she’s playing the dragon diva card hard. Being with egg makes shifting forms more difficult and is one of the very few times she’s semi-vulnerable. It would take a 25 SC to get her to change, with no magic adjustments allowed.

## Turtle Followers

Ommuran started as God to a large group of islands, worshipped for centuries, until she spent all her time protecting her islands while her horde barely grew. Applying what her and her people had learned protecting themselves, she reinvented her and her people as a security and operations outfit.

Her outfit is composed of a fleet of fast and nimble guide ships, multiple magically bonded agreements with various sea demi-gods, regional dragons, mages that owed her favor, and clerics from the few islands that still worshipped her, even though a bit judgey in calling her, in her current phase “The Confused God” or “Upsidedown” which to a turtle is pretty rude.

While a majority of her followers, or staff, are from her islands, there’s a wide range of other species, especially those that can breath underwater or fly through high winds. Regardless of species everyone is completely loyal, highly skilled, combat ready.

While they’re a bunch of bad assets normally they’re here on vacation too and aren’t looking for trouble. While constantly protective and attentive they’re relaxed by default and looking to celebrate.

Any amount of time talking to them will result in the party learning the back-story. They’re dying to share the good news of the egg.

They’re unconcerned about the over-staying their welcome, absorbing some of their leaders ambivalence and feeling cocking as tough security folk.

- if asked for tips or suggestions on how to get her to leave they’ll be upfront about offering something for her horde.
- any follower will happily setup as many meetings as the adventures would like

## The Races




Your job is to get rid of the dragon however possible, before the incoming vacationing fey/merfolk.

 Terki is about being pampered, being warm, and being praised. Also shiny things.

Charm

You need three successful charisma checks (15) for three days, failing resets. It can be anyone brought to the dragon, such as local bards, smooth talkers, charmers. Players are encouraged to meet locals and invite them.

### Bribe

- For 2% of their hordes worth they’ll scamper if asked nicely (15 SC  Charm)
- For 5% they’ll just go
- Goods have to delivered (side quest) deliver treasure to horde

### A Favor

The most common outcome is they talk to the dragon who offers a quest in exchange. It’s either to fetch something shiny, make her more comfortable, or get her drunk.

### Threaten 

- The only threat that’ll work is about her egg, and only if she’s sure they really know
- she’s utterly paranoid and, with a successful AC, will high-tail it out of there. On a nag 20 she’ll even pay them off
- if threstening her egg fails she’ll let them live after scaring them, as well a set 1-3 followers to tail the party for the rest of the time.
- a second attempt will get them rouged up
- both the followers and her will often hint at her being pregnant by making egg references
- the followers are protective but happy, they can confirm she’s with egg, with the clue “how her egg will glow!”

Kill

Killing is technically an option but unless it’s very obviously in self-defense or unavoidable no one will reward this path, mostly because it’s bad for business and the amount of property damage involved.

Since she’s pregnant, just there for the heated pools, she will inflict maximum damage quickly and then flee, with her followers dying to a person to protect her.
