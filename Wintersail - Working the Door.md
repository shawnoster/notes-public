# Wintersail - Working the Door

Wintersail

New adventurer talked into an easy option as someone just starting on a new path. Wakes up on the deck of a Orc pirate captain’s deck.

_why did you start to adventure_

A Dragon Turle and followers are also there to relax. The turtle is just floating in the middle of the bay and have decided to stay, which cuts into a centuries-old event, coming up in a week.

Your job is to get rid of the dragon however possible, before the incoming vacationing fey/merfolk.

 Terki is about being pampered, being warm, and being praised. Also shiny things.

Charm

You need three successful charisma checks (15) for three days, failing resets. It can be anyone brought to the dragon, such as local bards, smooth talkers, charmers. Players are encouraged to meet locals and invite them.

## Bribe

- For 2% of their hordes worth they’ll scamper if asked nicely (15 SC  Charm)
- For 5% they’ll just go
- Goods have to delivered (side quest) deliver treasure to horde

A Favor

The most common outcome is they talk to the dragon who offers a quest in exchange. It’s either to fetch something shiny, make her more comfortable, or get her drunk.

Threaten 

- The only threat that’ll work is about her egg, and only if she’s sure they really know
- she’s utterly paranoid and, with a successful AC, will high-tail it out of there. On a nag 20 she’ll even pay them off
- if threstening her egg fails she’ll let them live after scaring them, as well a set 1-3 followers to tail the party for the rest of the time.
- a second attempt will get them rouged up
- both the followers and her will often hint at her being pregnant by making egg references
- the followers are protective but happy, they can confirm she’s with egg, with the clue “how her egg will glow!”

Kill

Killing is technically an option but unless it’s very obviously in self-defense or unavoidable no one will reward this path, mostly because it’s bad for business and the amount of property damage involved.

Since she’s pregnant, just there for the heated pools, she will inflict maximum damage quickly and then flee, with her followers dying to a person to protect her.
