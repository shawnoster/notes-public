# The Order of Tides

## Overview

The Order of Tides is a medium-sized clerical order devoted to maintaining various powerful magical seals, pacts, writs of holding, tombs of imprisonment, wards of protection, and various other long-term rites and rituals that require some form of upkeep.

Mostly they're a group of mid-level managers organizing multi-decade projects, ensuring the proper sacrifices are in the right place, at the right time, with proper oversight. The majority of their contracts involve more time-management than mana.

### Why They're in Wintersail

One of their longest-running contracts is in Wintersail, specifically Wintersail's bay, every 17 years, and it's happening next weekend. The ritual is a standard celebration-themed, rune-drawing process, using boats to the trace the rune's shape across the entire bay. Navigating the same course over and over while the fear of unleashing an unknown horror on the world was sucking all the fun out of the ritual so they turned it into a race with a truly chaotic neutral party afterwards.

It's considered a perk to be assigned to the contract since it basically runs itself and comes with a week vacation in an amazing party spot with express orders to drink, fuck, eat, and indulge yourself as much as possible.

It's gone so smoothly, for so long, without needing oversight, that the original reason for the seal, and it's terrible world ending consequences, have been forgotten. Those that might have known are long dead or in rehab on another plane. It's honestly the least important detail of any contract and it's usually the same boilerplate apocalypse. Really, does anyone need to go past "world ending"?

### The Best Laid Plans

When the prep staff arrive to check on things and begging setting things up they learn of the Diva Dragon that refuses to leave Ritual Bay, thus jeopardizing the world, and shift to low-grade panic.

The priests are mostly low-level helpers or mid-level managers getting their turn on the island, hoping for an easy assignment followed by required debauchery.

Their leader, Sol Silverbold, is the only useful one.

### Actions

They arrive the night of Day Two, and head directly to the Swell to check-in with the owner. Anyone hanging around the center of town near dusk will see them walking quickly towards the resort, instantly marking them as out of place.

If pressed a local will connect the Ritual Race with the priests and remember that they always come early to stand over people's shoulders, annoying everyone, until the ritual is completed, and then they try and fuck everything around them.

#### Day Three

On Day Three they'll meet with Oum, where talks will quickly go wrong, and the more they try the more annoyed she gets, until they're kicked out and told not to come back.

If the party has talked w/ Oum the Priests will search them out, asking for help in clearing the bay. If not they'll ask around for people to speak on their behalf, offering a minor reward with a heavy focus on doom.

If talk of hordes or bribes comes up they'll offer to help, even though they feel the resort should pay instead. Regardless of the amount the Order can only come up with half the amount, and no amount of threats or magic will produce more. If the party doesn't already know the amount any follower can "suggest" an amount.

#### Day Four

If no other plan is in play, that they're aware of, then Sol will go to Plan B, which is a super rare artifact that can be attached to anything and then sent to another plan, usually one that's extremely harmful to the entity.

Sol hates this plan but is dedicated to his oath and Order. He will independently look for a party to place the artifact on the dragon, and will give them the entire bribe amount as payment. He will first approach the party, playing off the device as a gift but his guilt makes him easy to see through (5 DC).

If the party refuses after he comes clean he'll attempt to keep his plans quiet with a gag spell.

Anytime the party talks w/ Sol alone, and the closer it gets to having to kill the dragon, the most receptive to alternatives he'll be. This is a good time for the party to ask about the ritual itself, what'll happen if it fails, how it was created, etc.

- The party can also attempt to fool him by telling him the dragon has agreed to move, even if she hasn't, but it must clear a 10 DC.
- They can also try to kill or capture him but he will fight back in order to complete his oath, though he will try to not kill anyone.
- They can promise to complete the task but they'll have to offer their Word to his God as contract, and if they fail they will suffer.
- Left to his own Sol will contract a mercenary group to place the device that night. If the party stays or follows him they'll see the bandits and can pick a time to steal or kill.

None of this impresses the ancient dragon turtle relaxing in the center of Ritual Bay. She's worked hard, she paid top coin out of her own personal horde, and she deserves some self-care.

When her pact of residence is brought up she just throws money, literally, until they go away. When her and her staff explain in great detail about the ending of the world, including her, she just yawns. Been there and why bother even moving if the world really is ending? Finding no fault in her logic or any responsibility.

## Priests of Tides

These folk don't fuck around. This is pretty much their one task, the only thing they must do in exchange for some pretty sweet powers and favors. Plus, if you're lucky you get to go to the island for the after-party and talk about letting off some steam!

A Planning Committee staffed with Decision Makers were in-route as soon as they heard about the lack of early check-in. While not a huge deal they had coming there for years and expected better, plus this is what they drilled for.

The Priests aren't there yet, they'll arrive in two days, giving the team a chance to chill and feel things out. Once there they'll be obvious.

### Priests

A group of high-level priests have been dispatched to Wintersail to prep the ritual and once they learn about the dragon they go into full panic mode. They'll start by yelling at the resort owner, then talking to the Dragon, which will fail. Finally they'll turn towards darker means and hire mercenaries to plant a planer gate on the dragon, which will basically kill it.

The priests constantly bring up the dire consequences if the ritual doesn't happen but are vague, or out-right deceptive, about what will actually happen. Truth is almost no one remembers, even inside the Order, and it's their most guarded secret.

Tol Silverborn is the only one that knows this and will admit it (10 DC) with a little pushing, along with the location of the original ritual and seal as an option for finding other ways to fulfil the ritual without having to kill a Dragon Turtle.

#### NPCs

There are six priests in the group, all generic 1-3rd level clerics except their leader, a 6th level Elf cleric and veteran of five previous rituals, Tol Silverborn.

- Every day closer to the ritual that the dragon hasn't moved will make them more tense
- They will try to kill the dragon in order to make the rite happen
- They will talk, beg, plead, etc. with the dragon to please just give them those two days but they'll quickly piss her off and she'll refuse to speak with them
- They'll offer to help if asked
- They only half the amount needed for a pay-off
- They have one high charisma NPC that can help charm the dragon
