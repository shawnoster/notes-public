Phht, hey, Bungie, I've got a hustle for you. Nothing too analog, just a bit of silver in exchange for catching up an old reboot like myself.

You go through enough upgrades, well, they all start to look a bit the same. And that's when you figure a few things out about yourself. For me, I figured out I like to be caught up on the players and the landscape but I'm a drifter and hash-verified cynic.
